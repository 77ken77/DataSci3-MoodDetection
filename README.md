# Mood Detection and Face Identity Recognition using YOLOv8

This project demonstrates a real-time computer vision system capable of:
- 🔍 **Recognizing whether a detected face belongs to the user or someone else**
- 😀 **Classifying the user's mood** as **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, or **Confused**

It utilizes [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for object detection, OpenCV for webcam input, and Roboflow for dataset management.
